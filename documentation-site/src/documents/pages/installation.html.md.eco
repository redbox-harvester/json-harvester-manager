The Harvester Manager is a Grails application that exposes an API through which administrators or external applications can control the harvesters. 
As of writing, the API is unsecured and assumes that the server is running on a secured network. 
The code snippets below apply to Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit instance with Tomcat 7. 
Please adjust the commands as it pertains to your distribution and software stack of choice.

#### Install an application server, e.g. Tomcat. Use 8080 as the server port.

Install Tomcat7 on Debian-based (e.g. Ubuntu) distros:

	sudo apt-get -y install tomcat7 tomcat7-admin
	sudo chmod g+w /usr/share/tomcat7

#### [Download the harvester manager war file][ManagerWarSnapshot] and install it using the application-server specific method.
Deploying the Manager to Tomcat in a Ubuntu server:
