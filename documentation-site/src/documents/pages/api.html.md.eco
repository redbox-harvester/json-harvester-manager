The "API" are URLs that can be used to control harvesters within the Harvester Manager. When the return value is not explicitly stated, these URLs return a JSON document indicating the "status" of the request: if it has successfully processed it, and if not the "message" indicating the possible reason why the request had failed, e.g.:
 
	{"status":"true", "message":""}
